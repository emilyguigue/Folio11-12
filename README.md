# Folio11-12
Where I will be posting updates on Folio 11-12 

First ten lines read something like:
velociter exaudi me domi/ ne defecit spiritus meus/ non auertas faciem tu/ am a me et †similist† †ew† descé/ dentibus in lacum/ auditam fac mini ma/ ne misericordiam tuá quia/ in te speravi/ notam fac mini viam/ in qua ambulem quia ad

The parchment sounds dry. There is wear on the edges - browning that could be caused from binding the book. 

There are small holes that appear to be cut by a razor - this could be what was used by the monks to hold their paper down for copying

At the bottom right of the parchment and middle right it is thinner and almost transparent.

Some of the illumination is in tact and well preserved other sections are flaking off. 

Pores are visible on this side suggesting it is the flesh side.

There is a mark in the left corner from where it was once bent. 

There is a clear alignment tool used and ruling lines are visible. 

There are no pickings visible on the inner margins suggesting that someone cleaned up this manuscript at some point.
